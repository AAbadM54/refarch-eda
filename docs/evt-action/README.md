# Event Actions
In this chapter we address multiple consumer types:

# Function as a service
As a event consumer functions deliver stateless discrete step or task for the global event processing. The serverless approach will bring cost efficiency for the just on-demand invocation. It fits well in post processing with the event processing.
Cloud functions provides a simple way for developers to write code which takes action on an event.
Serverless computing model, complete abstraction of infrastructure away from the developer
No need to worry about infrastructure/scaling
Supports event notifications and event commands
Cost model reflects simple event processing, pay for event processing compute time only
