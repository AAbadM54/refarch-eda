# Event and Domain Driven Design

Event storming is part of the domain driven design methodology. There are a lot of literatures on domain-driven design, starting by [Eric Evans's book](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=asc_df_0321125215/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312118197030&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3363692763187919455&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032152&hvtargid=pla-449269547899&psc=1) from 2004. At IBM we also summarized the concepts needed for implementing microservice in [Kyle Brown's article](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/practices/code/domain-driven-design/overview).
